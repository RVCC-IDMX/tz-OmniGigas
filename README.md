### Tz.js

Use 3rd party libraries to create a command line utility that takes a

time zone and returns the currently time in that time zone. In this

assignment, use the moment.js and moment-timezone 3rd party libraries.

### App.js

Execute app.js and run the if statement in it. The if statement has 2

parts with another if statement being nested inside the 2nd part. The

program is executed be calling node and the program name (app.js). You

can pass a value to the ‘command’ and the if statement will check if

the value inside command matches what’s in the statement condition.
